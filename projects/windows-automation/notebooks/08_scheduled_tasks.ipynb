    "### What You Learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "✓ **Task Scheduler Basics** - Understanding components  \n",
    "✓ **Viewing Tasks** - Inspecting existing scheduled tasks  \n",
    "✓ **Creating Tasks** - Simple, daily, weekly, logon triggers  \n",
    "✓ **Managing Tasks** - Run, enable, disable, remove  \n",
    "✓ **Advanced Configuration** - Settings, conditions, multiple triggers  \n",
    "✓ **Automated Backup** - Production-ready backup system  \n",
    "✓ **Best Practices** - Error handling, logging, retention  \n",

    "### Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Always use full paths** in scheduled task scripts\n",
    "2. **Add logging** to track task execution\n",
    "3. **Set execution time limits** to prevent runaway tasks\n",
    "4. **Test manually first** before scheduling\n",
    "5. **Use -ExecutionPolicy Bypass** for script execution\n",
    "6. **Handle errors gracefully** with Try/Catch\n",
    "7. **Include cleanup logic** for old data\n",
    "8. **Document task purpose** in description\n",
    "9. **Monitor task results** regularly\n",
    "10. **Use -StartWhenAvailable** for missed runs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "- Daily backups\n",
    "- Log file rotation\n",
    "- Disk cleanup\n",
    "- Report generation\n",
