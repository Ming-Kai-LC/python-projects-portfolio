    "### Examples of Tasks You Can Automate:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **File Management**\n",
    "   - Organizing downloads folder\n",
    "   - Renaming multiple files at once\n",
    "   - Backing up important folders\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **System Maintenance**\n",
    "   - Cleaning temporary files\n",
    "   - Checking disk space\n",
    "   - Generating system reports\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Processing**\n",
    "   - Converting file formats\n",
    "   - Extracting information from files\n",

    "- **Age**: Legacy tool from MS-DOS days\n",
    "- **Pros**: Simple, widely available, fast for basic tasks\n",
    "- **Cons**: Limited functionality, outdated syntax\n",
    "- **Best For**: Simple file operations, quick commands\n",
    "- **File Extension**: `.bat` (batch files)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. PowerShell\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Age**: Modern (since 2006)\n",
    "- **Pros**: Powerful, object-oriented, extensive capabilities\n",
    "- **Cons**: Steeper learning curve (but worth it!)\n",
    "- **Best For**: Advanced automation, system administration\n",
    "- **File Extension**: `.ps1` (PowerShell scripts)\n",

    "Before we dive deeper, let's establish important safety rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rule 1: Always Test First\n",
    "- Test scripts in the practice folder\n",
    "- Never run unknown scripts on important files\n",
    "- Use `-WhatIf` parameter in PowerShell to preview actions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rule 2: Backup Important Data\n",
    "- Before running automation on real files, make backups\n",
    "- Keep backups in a different location\n",
    "- Verify backups work before deleting originals\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rule 3: Understand Before Running\n",
    "- Read scripts before executing them\n",
    "- Don't copy-paste commands you don't understand\n",
    "- Ask questions if uncertain\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rule 4: Be Careful with Administrator Privileges\n",
    "- Some operations require admin rights\n",
    "- Don't run scripts as admin unless necessary\n",
    "- Understand what admin commands do\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rule 5: Avoid Destructive Operations\n",
    "- Be extra careful with:\n",
    "  - Delete operations (`Remove-Item`)\n",
    "  - System file modifications\n",
    "  - Registry changes\n",
    "- Use `-Confirm` parameter for critical operations"
