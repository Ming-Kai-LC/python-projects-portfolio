    "# Module 11: Should/Shouldn't - Advice and Recommendations - Phase 1: Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "- Form affirmative and negative sentences with should/shouldn't\n",
    "- Use should/shouldn't to give advice and recommendations\n",
    "- Form questions with should and give appropriate responses\n",
    "- Express opinions about what is right or wrong\n",
    "- Distinguish between strong obligation (must) and advice (should)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Target Level:** A2\n",
    "**Estimated Time:** 4-5 hours\n",
    "**Modal Focus:** should/shouldn't\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Modal Verb Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "All modal verbs share these characteristics:\n",
    "- No -s in third person (he should, NOT he shoulds)\n",
    "- Followed by base verb (should go, NOT should to go)\n",
    "- No 'to' before the modal (NOT to should)\n",
    "- Questions: Modal + subject + base verb\n",
    "- Negatives: Modal + not + base verb"
