### Prerequisites
Before starting A2, you should have completed:
- ✅ All 20 A1 modules
- ✅ A1 review notebooks
- ✅ Basic understanding of present simple, past simple (was/were), and "going to" future

### Learning Path

**Recommended Pace:** 1 module per week

#### Week 1: Module 01
- Monday-Tuesday: Phase 1 (Introduction)
- Wednesday-Thursday: Phase 2 (Controlled Practice)
- Friday: Phase 3 (Meaningful Practice)
- Weekend: Phase 4 (Communicative Practice)

#### Weeks 2-5: Modules 02-05
Follow the same weekly structure for each module.

### Study Tips for A2 Level

1. **Build on A1 Foundation**
   - Review A1 past simple before starting Module 01
   - Make connections between what you already know and new grammar

2. **Focus on Accuracy**
   - A2 has more exercises (80-85 per module) for stronger grammar foundation
   - Take time to understand the rules before doing exercises
   - Review mistakes carefully

3. **Practice Speaking**
   - Read all exercises aloud
   - Record yourself doing communicative tasks
   - Focus on fluency while maintaining accuracy

4. **Use the 4-Phase Structure**
   - **Phase 1:** Understand the grammar concept thoroughly
   - **Phase 2:** Practice until formation becomes automatic
   - **Phase 3:** Make it personal - use YOUR life experiences
   - **Phase 4:** Communicate naturally in realistic scenarios

5. **Compare and Contrast**
   - A2 often involves choosing between similar structures
   - Create comparison charts (e.g., past simple vs past continuous)
   - Practice switching between tenses

### Enhanced Features in A2

- **More Exercises:** 80-85 exercises per module (vs 70 in A1)
- **Deeper Grammar:** More detailed explanations and formation rules
- **Complex Structures:** Combining multiple tenses and clauses
- **Real Communication:** More authentic, real-world scenarios
- **Critical Thinking:** Choosing appropriate forms based on context

## Progress Tracking

After completing each module:

1. Mark the module as complete in your progress tracker
2. Rate your confidence (1-5) with the grammar point
3. Note any areas that need review
4. Schedule spaced repetition reviews

## Common Challenges at A2

### Challenge 1: Choosing the Right Tense
**Solution:** Focus on the PURPOSE of what you're saying
- Past continuous: Describe the SCENE, BACKGROUND, or DURATION
- Past simple: Tell what HAPPENED, the MAIN EVENTS
- Present perfect: Connect PAST to PRESENT, or talk about EXPERIENCES

### Challenge 2: Form Overload
**Solution:** Practice one form at a time
- Master affirmative first
- Then negative
- Then questions
- Finally, mix them

### Challenge 3: Spelling -ing Forms
**Solution:** Learn the 4 spelling rules
1. Most verbs: just add -ing (work → working)
2. Verbs ending in -e: drop -e, add -ing (make → making)
3. One-syllable verbs with vowel + consonant: double final consonant (run → running)
4. Verbs ending in -ie: change to -y (lie → lying)
