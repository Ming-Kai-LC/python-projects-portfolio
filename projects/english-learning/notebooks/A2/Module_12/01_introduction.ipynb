    "# Module 12: Must/Have To - Obligation and Necessity - Phase 1: Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "- Form sentences with must and have to for obligations\n",
    "- Distinguish between must (internal obligation) and have to (external rules)\n",
    "- Use has to/have to correctly with different subjects\n",
    "- Form questions and negatives with have to (do/does + have to)\n",
    "- Understand when to use must vs have to in context\n",
    "\n",
    "**Target Level:** A2\n",
    "**Estimated Time:** 5-6 hours\n",
    "**Modal Focus:** must/have to\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Modal Verb Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "All modal verbs share these characteristics:\n",
    "- No -s in third person (he should, NOT he shoulds)\n",
    "- Followed by base verb (should go, NOT should to go)\n",
    "- No 'to' before the modal (NOT to should)\n",
    "- Questions: Modal + subject + base verb\n",
    "- Negatives: Modal + not + base verb"
